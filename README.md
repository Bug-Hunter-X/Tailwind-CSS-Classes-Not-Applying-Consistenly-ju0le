# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Consistently

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, particularly when using hover states or more complex class combinations.  The issue arises despite seemingly correct usage of the classes within the application.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains the code that demonstrates the issue.  The expected behavior is to have the paragraph's background change from red to blue on hover, however, this does not happen as expected.

## Solution

The solution can be found in `bugSolution.js`.  The solution addresses the inconsistency and provides a corrected version of the code to enable proper application of Tailwind CSS classes across different states and conditions.

## Setup

This example requires a basic understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. Make sure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the application using `npm start` or `yarn start`. (Adapt based on your preferred build setup)
